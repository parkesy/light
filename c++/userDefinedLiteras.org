* User defined literals.											  :Cpp14:
C++ now allows the programmer to programmatically define the meaning of user defined suffix to: integers, floating-point, character and strings.

User defined literals will need to begin with an underscore.
#+begin_src C++ :flags --std=c++14
#include <iostream>

// Literal operators 
int operator "" _hash(const char*, std::size_t t) { return /* do something more interesting */ t; } 
int operator "" _trunc(long double t) { return t; } 

int main()
{
   std::cout << "something"_hash << std::endl;
   std::cout << 3.1415_trunc << std::endl;
}
#+end_src

So what do we have here? New syntax. Which gives the left hand side primitive or cstring to a provided user defined function. The definition looks cumbersome, but the result is ok. I'm not exactly sure why we needed this "feature". I guess its a nice to have.
